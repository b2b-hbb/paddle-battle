make sure that there isn't a dependency issue
we only leverage stylus sdk inside the stylus_entrypoint
elsewhere, we rely on alloy and its primitives so that stylus sdk doesn't compile to the web
maybe only use the alloy primitives exported by stylus sdk to make sure that there arent versioning issues that create descrepencies in the future

Based on the code review, here are several modern architectural patterns you could consider to improve the entity and state management:
Component-Based Architecture (ECS)
Current: You have monolithic entities (Entity, Raft, RaftFighter) that contain all their properties and behaviors
Why: ECS would separate data (components) from behavior (systems), making it easier to:
Add new features without modifying existing code
Reuse components across different entity types
Better handle entity relationships and dependencies
Improve performance through better data locality and cache utilization
State Management Pattern
Current: You have a single GameState struct containing all game state
Why: Consider implementing a more sophisticated state management system that:
Separates concerns between different types of state (game state, UI state, network state)
Provides immutable state updates for better predictability
Makes it easier to implement features like undo/redo
Enables better state synchronization in multiplayer scenarios
Command Pattern for Actions
Current: Actions are likely handled directly in the game loop
Why: Implementing a command pattern would:
Make it easier to serialize/deserialize game actions
Enable better replay functionality
Make it easier to implement networking
Allow for better action validation and rollback
Resource Management System
Current: Resources (like styles, colors) are embedded in the entities
Why: A dedicated resource management system would:
Make it easier to load/unload resources
Enable better memory management
Make it easier to implement asset hot-reloading
Provide better resource sharing between entities
Event System
Current: State changes are likely handled directly
Why: An event system would:
Decouple state changes from their effects
Make it easier to implement features like achievements
Enable better debugging and logging
Make the system more extensible
Type-Safe Entity IDs
Current: Entities are likely referenced directly
Why: Using type-safe entity IDs would:
Prevent invalid entity references
Make it easier to handle entity lifecycle
Enable better memory management
Make it safer to handle entity deletion
Dependency Injection
Current: Dependencies are likely hardcoded
Why: DI would:
Make the code more testable
Make it easier to swap implementations
Reduce coupling between components
Make the system more modular
Spatial Partitioning
Current: Collision detection likely iterates through all entities
Why: Spatial partitioning would:
Improve performance for collision detection
Make it easier to handle large numbers of entities
Enable better physics simulation
Make it easier to implement AI behaviors
